        <h1>Average travel times during the 2016 viaduct closure</h1>
        <p>The state closed the Alaskan Way Viaduct for nine days in 2016 as a precaution when the tunnel-boring machine Bertha was digging the new Highway 99 tunnel directly under the elevated highway. The closure caused traffic delays throughout the area, giving travelers an idea what may be in store when the viaduct closes for good Jan. 11 and the new tunnel doesnâ€™t open for another three weeks. The red line shows average weekday travel times over five days during the closure. The gray line shows average weekday travel times in the four weeks before the closure.</p>
